# Scaling & Performance Documentation

This directory contains documentation on how the Nibble platform scales to handle growth in users, transactions, and data volume. It covers both architectural approaches and specific implementation details.

## Scaling Approach

The Nibble platform is designed for horizontal scalability using several key strategies:

## 1. Microservices Architecture

Our microservices architecture provides the foundation for scalability:

- **Independent Scaling**: Each service scales based on its specific demand
- **Resource Isolation**: Services don't compete for the same resources
- **Deployment Flexibility**: New instances can be added for high-demand services
- **Failure Containment**: Issues in one service don't affect others

### Service Scaling Factors

| Service | Primary Scaling Factors | Scaling Triggers |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Order Service | Order volume, concurrent users | CPU utilization >70%, response time >200ms |
| Restaurant Service | Number of restaurant partners | CPU utilization >60%, memory usage >70% |
| User Service | User registration rate, authentication rate | Response time >150ms, connection count >500 |
| Driver Service | Active drivers, location update frequency | CPU utilization >65%, queue depth >100 |
| Analytics Service | Event processing volume | Lag in event processing >30s |

## 2. Database Scaling Strategies

Our database architecture supports scaling through:

- **Schema Separation**: Each service uses its own database schema
- **Read Replicas**: Adding PostgreSQL read replicas for read-heavy services
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient management of database connections
- **Query Optimization**: Regular review and optimization of database queries
- **Indexing Strategy**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns

### Planned Database Evolution

For scaling beyond initial capacity:

1. **Vertical Scaling**: Initially increasing database server resources
2. **Read Replicas**: Adding read replicas for read-heavy services
3. **Sharding Preparation**: Designing schemas with future sharding in mind
4. **Database Sharding**: Implementing database sharding for high-volume services

## 3. Caching Strategy

Our multi-level caching strategy reduces database load:

- **Application-Level Caching**: Caching frequent computations
- **Redis Caching**: Distributed caching for session data, tokens, and frequent queries
- **HTTP Caching**: Leveraging HTTP cache headers for static content
- **Cache Invalidation**: Event-based invalidation to maintain consistency

### Cache Hierarchy

| Cache Type | Use Case | Lifetime | Invalidation Strategy |
|------------|----------|----------|------------------------|
| Local Memory Cache | Service-specific configuration | Process lifetime | Configuration change events |
| Redis Cache | Authentication tokens, user profiles | Minutes to hours | TTL + event-based invalidation |
| Redis Persistent | Shopping carts, preferences | Days | Explicit invalidation |
| HTTP Cache | Static assets, restaurant images | Days | URL versioning |

## 4. Asynchronous Processing

The platform leverages asynchronous processing to handle spikes and background tasks:

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using Kafka for asynchronous communication
- **Background Processing**: Non-critical tasks processed asynchronously
- **Work Queues**: Distributing processing tasks across multiple instances
- **Buffering**: Using Kafka to buffer messages during traffic spikes

### Key Asynchronous Flows

| Process | Implementation | Scaling Mechanism |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Order Notifications | Kafka events | Add consumers to notification group |
| Analytics Processing | Kafka â†’ Pinot | Increase Kafka partitions |
| Receipt Generation | Background tasks | Add worker instances |
| Location Processing | Event stream | Partition by geographic area |

## 5. Infrastructure Scaling

Our Docker-based infrastructure is designed for scaling:

- **Container Orchestration**: Using Docker Compose (production would use Kubernetes)
- **Stateless Services**: Services designed to be stateless for easy replication
- **Health Checks**: Monitoring service health for automated recovery
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across service instances

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. Database Optimization

- **Connection Pooling**: Using asyncpg connection pools
- **Query Optimization**: Regular EXPLAIN ANALYZE reviews
- **Indexing Strategy**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Denormalization**: Strategic denormalization for read performance
- **Materialized Views**: For complex, frequently accessed reports

### 2. API Optimization

- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination
- **Projection**: Selective field returns to minimize payload size
- **Compression**: Response compression for larger payloads
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse through Redis-based rate limiting
- **Batching**: Supporting batch operations for common scenarios

### 3. Caching Optimization

- **TTL Tuning**: Optimized cache expiration times based on data volatility
- **Cache Warming**: Pre-populating caches for common queries
- **Cache Analytics**: Monitoring cache hit rates to optimize strategy
- **Selective Caching**: Caching based on access patterns and resource cost

## Handling 1000x Growth

The platform is designed to scale to handle significant growth:

### 1. User Growth (1000x)

- **Authentication Service**: Separate dedicated service for auth
- **Read Replicas**: Multiple PostgreSQL read replicas
- **Distributed Caching**: Expanded Redis clusters
- **CDN Integration**: Content delivery network for static assets
- **Geo-Distribution**: Regional service deployments

### 2. Order Volume Growth (1000x)

- **Database Sharding**: Order database sharded by region/time
- **Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate read and write paths
- **Event Sourcing**: Rebuild state from event streams
- **Kafka Scaling**: Increased partitions and consumer groups
- **Read Optimization**: Heavy investment in caching and read replicas

### 3. Restaurant Growth (1000x)

- **Search Optimization**: Introduction of Elasticsearch for restaurant search
- **Geo-Partitioning**: Partitioning restaurant data by geographic region
- **Menu Caching**: Aggressive caching of menu data
- **Image Optimization**: CDN and image optimization pipeline
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous menu updates and inventory management

## Load Testing Strategy

Our approach to validating scalability:

1. **Service-Level Load Tests**: Testing individual service capacity
2. **Integration Load Tests**: Testing service interactions under load
3. **Realistic Scenario Tests**: Simulating real user behavior patterns
4. **Soak Testing**: Validating performance over extended periods
5. **Chaos Testing**: Validating resilience through failure injection

## Monitoring and Alerting

To support scaling, we implement comprehensive monitoring:

- **Service Metrics**: Response time, error rate, throughput
- **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, network, disk utilization
- **Business Metrics**: Orders per minute, active users, conversion rate
- **Database Metrics**: Query performance, connection count, lock contention
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerts for scaling thresholds
