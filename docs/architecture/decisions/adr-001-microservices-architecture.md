# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When designing the Nibble food delivery platform, we needed to make a fundamental decision about the architectural style. The system needs to:

- Scale independently for different components (e.g., ordering might need more resources during meal times)
- Support different teams working on different parts of the system
- Allow for technology diversity where appropriate
- Enable rapid feature development and deployment
- Provide resilience and fault isolation
- Handle complex domain logic across multiple bounded contexts

We considered both a monolithic architecture and a microservices architecture for this purpose.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a microservices architecture with the following core services:

1. API Gateway
2. User Service
3. Restaurant Service
4. Order Service
5. Driver Service
6. Admin Service
7. Analytics Service
8. Notification Service

Each service:
- Is independently deployable
- Has its own database schema
- Exposes a well-defined API
- Has clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Communicates with other services via defined interfaces (REST APIs or Kafka events)

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Independent Scaling**: Each service can scale based on its specific resource needs. For example, the Order Service can scale up during peak hours without scaling other services.
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the technologies best suited for its needs. While we're starting with FastAPI for all services, this allows future diversification if necessary.
- **Development Velocity**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously without tight coordination.
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't necessarily cascade to others. For example, if the Analytics Service experiences issues, core ordering functionality remains unaffected.
- **Simplified Complexity**: Each service focuses on a specific business domain, making the codebase more manageable.
- **Selective Deployment**: Updates can be deployed to specific services without redeploying the entire system.

### Negative

- **Operational Complexity**: Managing multiple services, databases, and deployment pipelines is more complex than a monolith.
- **Network Latency**: Service-to-service communication adds latency compared to in-process calls in a monolith.
- **Distributed System Challenges**: Issues like eventual consistency, distributed transactions, and network partitions must be addressed.
- **Resource Overhead**: Each service requires its own runtime environment, adding some resource overhead.
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing becomes more challenging across service boundaries.
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Tracing requests across multiple services requires sophisticated monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategies

To address the negative consequences, we will:

1. **Use Docker Compose** for simplified local development and deployment
2. **Implement Circuit Breakers** to prevent cascading failures
3. **Use Event-Driven Architecture** for asynchronous operations that don't require immediate consistency
4. **Establish Clear Service Contracts** with comprehensive API documentation
5. **Implement Distributed Tracing** to monitor request flows across services
6. **Create Development Guidelines** to ensure consistency across services
7. **Design for Eventual Consistency** where appropriate, rather than trying to maintain strict consistency

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture

We considered a monolithic architecture with the following characteristics:

- Single codebase and deployment unit
- Shared database
- Internal module boundaries

**Advantages**:
- Simpler initial development
- Less operational complexity
- No network latency between components
- Simpler transaction management
- Easier testing

**Disadvantages**:
- Scaling requires scaling the entire application
- Technology choices apply to the entire codebase
- Risk of becoming a "big ball of mud" as the system grows
- Deployment of any change requires redeploying everything
- Limited fault isolation

### Modular Monolith

We also considered a modular monolith approach:

- Single deployment unit but with strict module boundaries
- Shared database with schema separation
- Clear internal API boundaries

While this would provide some of the benefits of microservices with less operational complexity, we determined that the independent scalability and deployment benefits of microservices were critical for our use case.
