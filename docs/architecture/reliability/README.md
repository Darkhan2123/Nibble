# Failure Scenarios & Recovery

This directory contains documentation of potential failure scenarios in the Nibble platform and the strategies implemented to handle them. Understanding these scenarios is essential for maintaining system reliability and ensuring quick recovery from failures.

## Reliability Philosophy

The Nibble platform is designed with the following reliability principles:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: The system continues to function with reduced capabilities rather than failing completely
2. **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one component do not cascade to others
3. **Redundancy**: Critical components have redundancy to eliminate single points of failure
4. **Self-Healing**: The system can recover automatically from certain types of failures
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging to quickly identify and diagnose issues

## Common Failure Scenarios

This section documents common failure scenarios and our approach to handling them.

### 1. Service Failures

#### Scenario: Individual Microservice Becomes Unavailable

**Impact**:
- Functionality related to that service becomes unavailable
- Dependent services may experience degraded performance

**Detection**:
- Health check failures
- Increased error rates in service calls
- Timeout errors

**Recovery Strategy**:
- Docker's automatic restart policy attempts to restart the failed service
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures to other services
- API Gateway returns appropriate error responses for affected endpoints
- Critical operations use retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

**Example**: If the Restaurant Service fails:
- Customers can still browse existing restaurant data (cached)
- New restaurants cannot be added
- Menu updates are queued for processing when the service recovers
- Order placement continues for existing restaurants

### 2. Database Failures

#### Scenario: PostgreSQL Database Becomes Unavailable

**Impact**:
- Write operations fail for affected services
- Read operations may continue if using caching

**Detection**:
- Database connection errors
- Service health check failures
- Increased error rates in database operations

**Recovery Strategy**:
- Connection pooling with retry logic
- Fallback to read-only mode where applicable
- Caching of critical data to maintain read operations
- Automatic database failover (in production environment)

**Example**: If the Order database fails:
- New orders are temporarily stored in memory/cache
- Order history is unavailable or limited to cached data
- When database recovers, pending orders are processed from the queue

### 3. Kafka Failures

#### Scenario: Kafka Broker or Cluster Becomes Unavailable

**Impact**:
- Asynchronous operations are delayed
- Event-driven workflows are paused
- Some data consistency operations may be delayed

**Detection**:
- Kafka connection errors
- Increased latency in event processing
- Failed message publishing

**Recovery Strategy**:
- Producers implement retry logic with backoff
- Critical events use alternative synchronous endpoints as fallback
- Events are queued in local memory when possible
- When Kafka recovers, accumulated events are processed

**Example**: If Kafka is unavailable:
- Order creation still works (synchronous path)
- Notifications are queued locally
- Analytics events are buffered until connectivity is restored
- When Kafka recovers, all queued events are published

### 4. External Service Failures

#### Scenario: Payment Processor or Map Service Becomes Unavailable

**Impact**:
- Payment processing or location-based features are affected
- User experience degradation for specific features

**Detection**:
- External API call failures
- Timeout errors
- Increased latency

**Recovery Strategy**:
- Circuit breakers prevent repeated failed calls
- Graceful fallbacks with clear user messaging
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Alternative providers where available

**Example**: If payment processor is unavailable:
- Orders are accepted but marked as "payment pending"
- Users receive clear messaging about the payment issue
- System periodically retries payment processing
- Support is notified if issues persist beyond thresholds

### 5. Cache Failures

#### Scenario: Redis Cache Becomes Unavailable

**Impact**:
- Increased database load
- Slower response times
- Session information may be temporarily lost

**Detection**:
- Redis connection errors
- Increased database query volume
- Performance degradation

**Recovery Strategy**:
- Fallback to direct database queries
- In-memory caching as temporary measure
- Clear error handling for authentication issues
- Automatic reconnection when Redis becomes available

**Example**: If Redis fails:
- Authentication falls back to JWT verification without Redis
- Shopping carts redirect to database storage
- Performance degrades but system remains functional
- When Redis recovers, caches are gradually rebuilt

## Complex Failure Scenarios

### 1. Network Partition

**Scenario**: Network issues cause services to be unable to communicate with each other

**Impact**:
- Services continue to run but cannot exchange data
- Data inconsistency between services

**Recovery Strategy**:
- Service health checks detect connectivity issues
- Event sourcing patterns allow state reconstruction
- Reconciliation processes run after connectivity is restored
- Clear indicators to users when system is in degraded state

### 2. Cascading Failures

**Scenario**: Failure in one service triggers failures in dependent services

**Prevention and Recovery**:
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading calls to failing services
- Resource isolation ensures services don't compete for resources
- Fallback strategies for critical dependencies
- Gradual recovery to prevent thundering herd problem

### 3. Data Corruption

**Scenario**: Database or cache contains corrupted data

**Prevention and Recovery**:
- Schema validation on all data operations
- Regular database backups
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Audit logs to track data changes
- Reconciliation processes for detecting and fixing inconsistencies

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Automated Recovery

Many recovery procedures are automated:

- **Service Restarts**: Docker automatically restarts failed containers
- **Circuit Breaking**: Services automatically detect and isolate failing dependencies
- **Reconnection Logic**: Services automatically reconnect to databases and Kafka
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Failed operations are retried with appropriate backoff

### 2. Manual Recovery Procedures

For scenarios requiring human intervention:

- **Database Recovery**: Procedures for restoring from backups
- **Data Reconciliation**: Processes for fixing data inconsistencies
- **Service Deployment**: Procedures for rolling back to previous versions
- **Infrastructure Scaling**: Adding resources during overload situations

## Resilience Testing

To ensure the system handles failures gracefully:

- **Chaos Engineering**: Controlled injection of failures in pre-production
- **Failure Drills**: Regular testing of recovery procedures
- **Load Testing**: Validating behavior under extreme load
- **Failover Testing**: Verifying redundancy mechanisms

## Service-Specific Resilience Features

### Order Service Resilience

- **Order State Machine**: Clear state transitions with idempotent operations
- **Payment Retry Logic**: Automated retries for failed payments
- **Order Event Log**: Complete event history for reconstructing order state
- **Compensating Transactions**: For rolling back partial order processing

### User Service Resilience

- **Token Caching**: Distributed authentication state
- **Profile Caching**: Reduced database dependency for profile data
- **Session Recovery**: Mechanism for recovering user sessions
- **Auth Fallbacks**: Alternative authentication paths if primary fails

### Restaurant Service Resilience

- **Menu Caching**: Reduced dependency on database for menu data
- **Availability Tracking**: Mechanism to handle restaurant status changes
- **Order Queueing**: Buffer for incoming orders during processing issues
- **Offline Mode**: Support for restaurants to operate with intermittent connectivity

### Driver Service Resilience

- **Location Buffering**: Store location updates locally during connectivity issues
- **Assignment Caching**: Maintain delivery assignments during service disruptions
- **Offline Navigation**: Support for drivers during map service outages
- **Delivery Reconciliation**: Process for resolving delivery status inconsistencies

## Monitoring and Alerting

To quickly detect and respond to failures:

- **Health Checks**: Regular validation of service status
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Tracking of error rates by service and endpoint
- **Latency Monitoring**: Identifying performance degradation
- **Dependency Checks**: Validation of external service availability
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for different types of issues
